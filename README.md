# ionic-tipcalculator

Followed the "Hands on iOS development" on Thu 3/12/15 at Apporable in SF, the speaker presented us a tip calculator development session
in ObjC and under Xcode. I thought this kind of app is ideal a a starter point for newbies and I decided to publish this repo as a starting
point for people wanting to use Ionicframework.

# ionic-tipcalculator

## about

Followed the "Hands on iOS development" on Thu 3/12/15 at Apporable in SF, the speaker presented us a tip calculator development session
in ObjC and under Xcode. I thought this kind of app is ideal a a starter point for newbies and I decided to publish this repo as a starting
point for people wanting to use Ionicframework.

## what you need

* install ionicframework (install nodejs then `npm install -g ionic`)
* clone this repo or just download `www/index.html` and `www/js/app.js`
* do `ionic platform add android` or `ionic platform add ios` (depending on your target but you) can do both
* try with `ionic run <platform>` or `ionic serve` to try in browser
